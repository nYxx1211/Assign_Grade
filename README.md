# Assign_Grade
This Phyton program assigns a letter grade to a student based on their score. I created this by only using Thonny, and a handout that was given to me by my professor.
This activity involves writing a function that assigns a letter grade to a student based on their score. The function, named assign_grade(score), will take an integer score as input and use if-elif-else statements to assign grades as follows: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), and F (below 60). If a student enters an invalid score (less than 0 or greater than 100), the function should print a message like "Invalid score! Please enter a value between 0 and 100.". When calling assign_grade(95), the function should print "Grade: A", while assign_grade(50) should print "Grade: F". Students will test the function with various inputs to ensure it assigns the correct grades.
